# xRM - Calculate your 1 rep max and beyond  
  
Try it out [here](https://woahjo.github.io/oneRM/). 
xRM was created to help lifters access their potential 1 - 10 rep max. xRM uses the [Brzycki formula](https://www.fxsolver.com/browse/formulas/One-repetition+maximum+%28Brzycki+formula%29) to calculate maxes. 

## How it works:  
  
Enter the weight and the number of reps you can perform with the given weight and hit `Go`. xRM will calculate and display your rep maxes up to 10 reps. Please keep in mind that the maxes are just estimates. Always use care when working with heavy weights and be sure to listen to your body.
